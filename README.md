### 💭 Reflection (STAR Format)

*S (Situation):*  
At the beginning of my Work Integrated Learning placement at Plum Systems, I needed to identify my core competencies and align them with my career goals in software development.

*T (Task):*  
I was tasked with completing a skills self-assessment and an interest inventory to better understand where my strengths lie and how they map to industry needs, especially in web development technologies like React and Firebase.

*A (Action):*  
I documented both my hard skills (such as JavaScript, React, Firebase, Git, and REST API integration) and soft skills (communication, collaboration, time management). I then compared my profile against various job descriptions and team expectations during my internship.

*R (Result):*  
Through this reflection and practical experience, I’ve gained a clear understanding of how my technical interests—like front-end development and AI integration—align with a professional career in full-stack or front-end development. I also realized my growing interest in productivity tools and educational tech solutions, as seen in projects like the Task-ToDo and Smart Learning Management System (SLPMS).
